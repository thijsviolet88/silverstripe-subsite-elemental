# TinyMCE Language Packages

These language packages are downloaded from https://www.tiny.cloud/get-tiny/language-packages/

They are provided by members of the tinymce community, and have varying levels of completeness. We should update this directory periodically by re-downloading the full .zip file with all languages.

If there are new languages provided, the TinyMCEConfig.tinymce_lang configuration property will need to be updated.
